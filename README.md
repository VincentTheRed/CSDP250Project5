# CSDP250Project5
Binary Search Tree Project

Description
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. It includes functionalities to insert, search, and delete nodes, and perform various tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, and post-order). The program also includes a feature to check if the tree is an AVL tree (balancing not included). The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the application of BSTs in organizing and accessing data efficiently.

Features
Random Number Generation: Generates 35 random numbers and inserts them into the BST.
Tree Traversals: Supports in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
Node Deletion: Allows users to delete a node from the BST.
AVL Check: Checks whether the tree is an AVL tree (balanced or not).

Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
Compile the source files. For example, using GCC:

g++ -o BSTProject main.cpp BinarySearchTree.cpp

Run the compiled executable:
Copy code
./BSTProject

Usage
The program will automatically generate 35 random numbers and insert them into the BST.
Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the tree.
You can delete a node by entering its value when prompted.
After deletion, the tree will be displayed in post-order traversal.
The program will then indicate if the current tree structure is an AVL tree.
